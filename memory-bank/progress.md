# Progress: RoutineTrace

## Current Status (as of Memory Bank Initialization)

- **Project Phase:** Initial setup and documentation.
- **Application Development:** No application code has been written yet beyond the existing boilerplate/structure provided in the initial file listing.
- **Memory Bank:** Core Memory Bank files are currently being created.
  - `projectbrief.md`: Created.
  - `productContext.md`: Created.
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Created.
  - `techContext.md`: Created.
  - `activeContext.md`: Created.
  - `progress.md`: Currently being created.

## What Works

- **Project Definition:** The project's purpose, scope, tech stack, and database schema are well-defined in `.clinerules` and now captured in the Memory Bank.
- **Development Environment (Assumed):** The file structure suggests a working ReactNative Expo project setup is in place.
- **Memory Bank Structure:** The process of creating the Memory Bank files according to the specified structure is underway.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level - Entire Application)

This list represents the overall project goals, not immediate next steps.

1.  **User Authentication:**
    - Login screen (`app/login.tsx`).
    - Registration screen (`app/register.tsx`).
    - Session management (`hooks/useSession.ts`, `context/AuthenticationProvider.tsx`).
    - Sign out functionality (`app/(drawer)/signout.tsx`).
2.  **Onboarding Flow:**
    - Splash screen (`app/(onboarding)/splash.tsx`).
    - Start screen (`app/(onboarding)/start.tsx`).
    - Tutorial (`app/(onboarding)/tutorial.tsx`).
3.  **Core Task Management Features:**
    - Displaying tasks (e.g., in `app/(drawer)/index.tsx`).
    - Creating tasks (`app/(tasks)/create-task.tsx`).
    - Viewing/Editing task details (`app/(tasks)/[id].tsx`, `app/(tasks)/edit/[id].tsx`).
    - Implementing checklist functionality within tasks (`components/ChecklistSection.tsx`, `components/edit/ChecklistEditor.tsx`).
    - Handling task completion and state updates.
    - Implementing task recurrence logic (interpreting `repeat_on_wk`, `repeat_frequency`, `repeat_period`).
    - Calculating and displaying task success percentages (`components/TaskSuccessPercentage.tsx`).
4.  **Navigation Structure:**
    - Setting up Drawer navigation (`app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx`).
    - Integrating Tab navigation if applicable (as per "drawer+tabs" in `.clinerules`).
5.  **Settings Screen:**
    - Implementing `app/(drawer)/settings.tsx`.
6.  **Stats Screen:**
    - Implementing `app/(drawer)/stats.tsx` (likely for health/happiness and overall task stats).
7.  **Health and Happiness Tracking:**
    - UI for logging health/happiness.
    - Backend integration for `health_and_happiness` table.
8.  **Task Completion History:**
    - Storing and retrieving data from `task_completion_history` table.
    - Using this data for success percentage calculations.
9.  **UI Styling and Theming:**
    - Applying custom fonts and colors defined in `.clinerules`.
    - Ensuring consistent UI using React Native Elements and `theme/` styles.
10. **Error Handling & Reporting:**
    - Integrating Neverthrow throughout the application.
    - Setting up Sentry for production error monitoring.
11. **Data Persistence and Sync:**
    - Robust integration with Supabase using TanStack Query for all server state.
    - Using AsyncStorage for relevant client-side persisted state.
12. **Specific UI Components from File List:**
    - Many components are listed (e.g., `DraggableFlatList`, `Header`, `FormFieldInfo`, etc.) that will need to be implemented or integrated.

## Known Issues (at this very early stage)

- None directly related to code, as development hasn't started.
- Potential Issue: Ensuring the Supabase backend (schema, RLS policies) is perfectly aligned with the application's needs as development progresses.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Decision (Implicit):** To bootstrap the project understanding by creating a comprehensive Memory Bank first. This is driven by Cline's operational model.
- Future decisions will be tracked here as the project evolves.
