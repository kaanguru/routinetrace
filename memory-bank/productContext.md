# Product Context: RoutineTrace

## Why This Project Exists

RoutineTrace exists to address the common challenge of maintaining consistency with recurring tasks and routines. Many individuals struggle to build and stick to daily, weekly, or monthly habits. This application aims to provide a dedicated tool to manage these routines effectively and visualize progress over time.

## Problems It Solves

1.  **Difficulty in Tracking Recurring Tasks:** Standard to-do list apps may not be optimized for tasks that repeat regularly with specific frequencies or on particular days.
2.  **Lack of Motivation for Routine Maintenance:** Without clear feedback on consistency, users might lose motivation to stick to their routines.
3.  **Poor Insight into Habit Formation:** Users often lack a clear view of how well they are adhering to their planned routines over extended periods.
4.  **Managing Complex Routines:** Some routines involve multiple steps (checklist items) which need to be tracked individually within a larger task.

## How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

- **Intuitive Task Creation:** Users should be able to easily create tasks, define their recurrence (daily, weekly, monthly, specific days, frequency), and add notes or checklist items.
- **Clear Overview of Daily Tasks:** The app should present a clear list of tasks due on the current day.
- **Simple Task Completion:** Marking tasks or checklist items as complete should be straightforward.
- **Visual Progress Tracking:** The app will display a success percentage for routine tasks, providing users with a visual indicator of their consistency. This is a core feature.
- **Health and Happiness Correlation (Optional but Desired):** The ability to log health and happiness levels could provide users with insights into how their routines affect their well-being, though this is a secondary feature compared to task management.
- **Seamless Navigation:** Using a drawer and tab-based navigation (as per Expo Router setup) should provide an organized and easy-to-navigate user experience.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user accounts are necessary to store personal task data (via Supabase Auth).
- **Minimalist and Focused UI:** The interface, built with React Native Elements, should be clean and focused on the core functionality of managing routines, avoiding unnecessary clutter.
- **Reliable Data Sync:** Task data should be reliably stored and synced using Supabase.

## User Experience Goals

- **Empowerment:** Users should feel empowered to take control of their routines and build positive habits.
- **Motivation:** Visual feedback (success percentages) should motivate users to maintain consistency.
- **Clarity:** The app should provide a clear and unambiguous view of what needs to be done and how well the user is performing.
- **Simplicity:** Despite the potential complexity of recurring schedules, the user interface should remain simple and easy to understand.
- **Reliability:** Users must trust that their data is safe and that the app functions consistently.
