2. Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy
This section details the architectural boundaries and approach for integrating the local-first capabilities into RoutineTrace.

Enhancement Overview
Enhancement Type: Major Architectural Modification.

Scope: The project will shift from an "online-first" architecture to a "local-first" model. This involves introducing WatermelonDB as the primary client database and building a background synchronization service to communicate with the Supabase backend.

Integration Impact: This is a Major Impact enhancement. It will fundamentally refactor the application's entire data management layer.

Integration Approach
The architecture will be refactored to ensure all UI components are completely decoupled from direct network requests.

Code Integration Strategy: Existing data-fetching and mutation hooks (built with TanStack Query) will be modified. Instead of calling Supabase directly, they will now read from and write to the local WatermelonDB instance. A new, isolated syncService.ts will be created to handle all communication with the Supabase backend.

Database Integration: A new WatermelonDB (SQLite) database will be introduced on the client side. Its schema will mirror the existing Supabase schema to ensure data compatibility. All UI components will source their data from this local database, making the application inherently offline-capable.

API Integration: All direct calls to the Supabase client from UI-facing hooks will be eliminated. The syncService.ts will become the sole gateway for all network API calls, centralizing the logic for pushing and pulling data.

UI Integration: UI components will become reactive to local data changes through WatermelonDB's observable queries. This will provide an immediate, "optimistic" user experience where the UI updates instantly, regardless of network status.

Compatibility Requirements
Maintaining system integrity and consistency is paramount during this enhancement.

API Compatibility: The public-facing Supabase API and schema will not be changed. The integration will happen entirely on the client side.

Database Schema Compatibility: The new WatermelonDB schema must be kept in sync with the remote Supabase schema. A supabase_id column will be used in local tables to map records between the two databases.

UI/UX Consistency: The user interface will continue to use React Native Elements. From a user's perspective, the change should manifest as a significant improvement in responsiveness and the new ability to use the app fully offline.

Performance Impact: While the goal is to improve perceived UI performance, the background synchronization process must be designed to not degrade UI responsiveness or cause excessive battery drain.
