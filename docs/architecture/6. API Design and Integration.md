6. API Design and Integration
For this brownfield enhancement, no new backend API endpoints will be created or modified.

The existing Supabase backend provides a standard set of RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on each database table (e.g., tasks, checklistitems), and this API will continue to be used as-is.

The architectural change is in how this API is consumed on the client:

API Client: The new SyncService will be the sole client-side component that interacts with the existing Supabase API.

API Integration Strategy: Instead of UI-facing hooks calling the API directly, the SyncService will now be responsible for all communication, such as fetching changed records or pushing local updates to the existing Supabase endpoints.

This approach isolates all client-side changes and requires no modifications to the backend API, reducing the overall complexity and risk of the enhancement.
