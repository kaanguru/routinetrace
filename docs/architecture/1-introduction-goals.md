# **1. Introduction & Goals**

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the **RoutineTrace** application with a robust offline-first capability. The primary goal is to allow users to create, view, and modify their routines seamlessly, with or without an internet connection. This will be achieved by integrating the **Legend-State** library to manage state and data synchronization with the existing **Supabase** backend.
