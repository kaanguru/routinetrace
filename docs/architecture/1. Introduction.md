1. Introduction
This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the RoutineTrace application by implementing a local-first data layer with WatermelonDB. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for this significant enhancement, ensuring seamless and safe integration with the existing system. This architecture will define how new components and data flow patterns are introduced while respecting the established technical foundation.

Existing Project Analysis
My analysis of the existing project is based on the provided Product Requirements Documents. This understanding forms the foundation for all subsequent architectural decisions.

Current Project State:

Primary Purpose: RoutineTrace is an Android mobile application designed to help users manage and track recurring tasks, with a key feature being the visualization of success percentages to motivate adherence.

Current Tech Stack: The application is built using React Native and Expo, with TypeScript as the primary language. The backend is Supabase (PostgreSQL and Auth), and the UI is built with React Native Elements.

Current Architecture Style: The project currently follows an "online-first" model, where the application interacts directly with the Supabase backend for all data operations. The codebase is in its initial, foundational stage.

Available Documentation:

The project's technical direction is guided by the PRD, which specifies the technology stack, database schema for tables like tasks and checklistitems, and core architectural principles.

Identified Constraints:

Technology Stack: The enhancement must integrate with the existing stack, including React Native, Expo, Supabase, TanStack Query, and React Native Elements.

Architectural Patterns: The project mandates a strict functional programming paradigm, immutability, and the use of the Neverthrow library for handling operational success/failure.

Database Schema: The new local database schema must be compatible with and mirror the existing Supabase schema structure defined for the project.
