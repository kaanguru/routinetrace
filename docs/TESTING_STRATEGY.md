# Testing Strategy for Offline-First Features

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for testing offline-first features within the RoutineTrace application. A key aspect of this strategy is the effective simulation of offline conditions during development and in Continuous Integration (CI) environments. This ensures that the application's data persistence, synchronization, and user experience remain robust even when network connectivity is intermittent or unavailable.

## Development Environment Simulation

To test offline capabilities during local development, developers can utilize several methods:

### 1. Expo Go Developer Menu:
   - **Method:** When running the app in Expo Go on a physical device or emulator, access the developer menu (shake device or use command `Ctrl+M` / `Cmd+M` in emulator).
   - **Action:** Look for options to simulate network conditions, such as "Disable Network" or "Offline Mode". If such an option is not directly available, developers can manually disconnect their device/emulator from the network.
   - **Verification:** Test core functionalities like creating, updating, and viewing tasks while the device is offline. Ensure data is stored locally and syncs correctly once connectivity is restored.

### 2. Network Throttling Tools:
   - **Method:** Utilize browser developer tools (if testing in a web-like environment or using tools that integrate with browser networking) or dedicated network throttling applications.
   - **Action:** Set network conditions to "Offline" or simulate high latency and packet loss.
   - **Verification:** Observe application behavior under simulated poor network conditions.

### 3. Mocking Network Requests (for Unit/Integration Tests):
   - **Method:** Libraries like `jest-fetch-mock` or `msw` (Mock Service Worker) can be used to intercept network requests made by the application.
   - **Action:** Configure mocks to return errors or empty responses when network calls are made, simulating an offline state.
   - **Verification:** Run unit and integration tests that specifically target offline data handling logic.

## CI Environment Simulation

Simulating offline conditions in CI is crucial for automated testing.

### 1. Network Request Mocking:
   - **Method:** Integrate network request mocking into the CI test suite.
   - **Action:** Intercept API calls (e.g., to Supabase) and return simulated responses that mimic an offline scenario (e.g., network errors, timeouts). This can be done using Jest mocks or similar tools.
   - **Verification:** Ensure that tests covering data synchronization and error handling when offline pass reliably.

### 2. CI/CD Configuration:
   - **Method:** Some CI/CD platforms might offer ways to control network access for build agents.
   - **Action:** If available, configure the CI environment to restrict outbound network connections during specific test stages.
   - **Verification:** Run end-to-end tests in this restricted network environment.

## Testing Tools and Libraries

-   **Jest:** For unit and integration tests. Can be extended with network mocking libraries.
-   **React Native Testing Library:** For component-level testing, allowing interaction with components and checking their behavior.
-   **WatermelonDB:** The underlying database library provides its own mechanisms for handling offline states and synchronization. Tests should also verify that WatermelonDB's internal logic behaves as expected.
-   **Expo Go:** Useful for manual testing on devices/emulators with network simulation options.

## Conclusion

By employing a combination of development environment tools and robust mocking strategies in CI, we can effectively test the offline-first capabilities of the RoutineTrace application. This ensures a resilient and user-friendly experience regardless of network availability.
