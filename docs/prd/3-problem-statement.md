# 3. Problem Statement
Many existing to-do list applications lack specialized features for managing recurring tasks and providing feedback on routine adherence. Users struggle with:

Effectively tracking tasks that repeat on specific days or intervals.
Maintaining motivation for routine tasks due to a lack of visual progress indicators.
Managing complex routines involving multiple sub-steps (checklist items).
Gaining insight into how well they are truly sticking to their habits over time.
RoutineTrace aims to solve these problems by offering a dedicated platform tailored for routine management and progress visualization.
