# 5. Scope
In-Scope (High-Level Features):

User Authentication: Secure login, registration, and session management via Supabase Auth.
Task Management (CRUD): Creation, viewing, editing, and deletion of tasks with attributes like title, notes, completion status, and position.
Recurring Task Logic:
Defining tasks to repeat on specific days_of_week (Mon-Sun).
Setting repeat_frequency (e.g., every 2 days).
Specifying repeat_period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).
Algorithm to determine tasks due on a given day.
Checklist Item Management: Adding, editing, completing, and reordering sub-items within a task.
Task Completion Tracking: Recording task_completion_history to calculate success percentages.
Health and Happiness Tracking: Optional feature for users to log health and happiness scores.
Navigation: Intuitive navigation using Expo Router with drawer and tab structures.
UI/UX: Responsive design using React Native Elements, adhering to defined fonts and color schemes.
Data Synchronization: Robust client-server data synchronization with Supabase, initially implementing foundational offline-first capabilities using Legend-State for enhanced user experience and data availability.
Out-of-Scope (for this phase - derived from "What's Left to Build" and "Known Issues" in progress.md):

Comprehensive Data Analytics: While success percentage is in scope, advanced reporting beyond this is not.
Cross-Platform (iOS/Web): Primary focus is Android initially.
Advanced Sharing/Collaboration: Tasks are currently user-specific.
Integrations: No third-party API integrations (e.g., calendar, health apps).
Realtime Updates: While Supabase supports it, active realtime subscription for all data is not a core requirement for task display in this phase.
Deep Offline-First Capabilities: While foundational offline-first capabilities via Legend-State are now in scope, advanced features such as complex conflict resolution strategies are considered for a subsequent phase.
6. Features/User Stories
Authentication & User Management:
As a new user, I can register for an account using my email and password.
As a registered user, I can log in and out of the application securely.
As a registered user, I can reset my password if forgotten.
Task Creation & Editing:
As a user, I can create a new task with a title, optional notes, and set its recurrence properties.
As a user, I can add multiple checklist items to a task, each with content and a completion status.
As a user, I can edit existing tasks and their checklist items.
As a user, I can reorder tasks and checklist items.
Task Completion:
As a user, I can mark a task as complete, which should update its status and record completion history.
As a user, I can mark individual checklist items as complete.
Task Viewing & Organization:
As a user, I can view a list of tasks due for the current day.
As a user, I can view tasks in a list, with the ability to navigate between day, week, month views if implemented.
As a user, I can view previously completed tasks.
Routine Tracking & Analytics:
As a user, I can see a success percentage for my recurring tasks, indicating my consistency.
As a user, I can optionally log my daily health and happiness levels.
Navigation & Settings:
As a user, I can easily navigate through the app using a drawer menu and potentially tabs.
As a user, I can access a settings screen to manage app preferences.
As a user, I can continue to use the app to manage my tasks and view my routine progress even when I am offline.
As a user, my changes made while offline are automatically synchronized with the server when an internet connection becomes available.
7. User Experience (UX) Requirements
Intuitive & Simple: The app should be easy to learn and use, minimizing cognitive load for routine management.
Responsive: UI updates should be immediate upon user interaction, providing a fluid experience.
Clear Feedback: Users should receive clear visual cues for actions (e.g., task completion, data loading).
Engaging: Visual progress indicators and positive reinforcement should motivate users.
Consistent: Navigation, layout, and component styling should be consistent throughout the application.
Aesthetic: Adhere to the defined color palette and typography (Inter_900Black, DelaGothicOne_400Regular, UbuntuMono_400Regular, etc.).
8. Technical Requirements & Constraints (Brownfield Context)
Current State & Brownfield Context:
The project is in its initial setup and documentation phase. Core Memory Bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md) have been created, providing a strong foundation for understanding. No application code has been written beyond the existing boilerplate/structure provided.

Frontend Technologies:
React Native + Expo: The chosen framework for mobile application development (targeting Android).
TypeScript: All codebase must be written in TypeScript, leveraging type safety.
React Native Elements (@rneui/themed): All UI components must utilize this library for consistency.
Expo Router: File-system based routing for navigation (drawer and tabs).
Legend-State: Primary choice for client-side state management, reactivity, data persistence, and synchronization with Supabase. Custom hooks will encapsulate data interaction logic.
TanStack Form: For building and managing form state, validation, and submission.
react-native-async-storage/async-storage: For global client-side persistent state (non-server derived).
React Context/useState/useReducer: For local component-level and shared local state.
utils/supabase.ts: This file is critical for Supabase client initialization and will NOT be modified.
Backend Technologies:
Supabase: The Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providing:
PostgreSQL Database: As defined in .clinerules, including tables for tasks, checklistitems, health_and_happiness, task_completion_history, and enumerated types days_of_week, repeat_period.
Supabase Auth: For user authentication and authorization.
Supabase JavaScript Client: All database interactions must use this client library.
Supabase Generated Types (database.types.ts): Essential for type-safe database interactions.
Code Quality & Architecture:
Functional Paradigm: All components and hooks must be functional. Pure functions marked with function keyword, moved to end of file for helpers.
Immutability: Strict adherence to immutability. No mutation of existing objects or arrays by assignment/deletion. Use const over let. Readonly types for function parameters where applicable.
Error Handling:
Neverthrow: Must be used for operational success/failure modeling (Result, ResultAsync). All functions that can fail should return Result or ResultAsync.
Sentry: Planned for production error monitoring (details TBD).
utils/reportError.ts: Standardized utility for error processing.
No Class Inheritance: Prohibited.
Performance: Be mindful of performance, especially for lists. Optimize rendering with React.memo, useCallback, and FlatList.
Security: Leverage Supabase's secure authentication and database interactions. Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) policies are correctly implemented in Supabase.
9. Dependencies
Supabase Project: A pre-configured Supabase project with the defined database schema and authentication.
Node.js & pnpm: Development environment dependencies.
Expo CLI: For project development and builds.
Android SDK/Emulator: For running and testing the Android application.
Context7: For documentation lookup during development.
10. Future Considerations/Roadmap
Comprehensive Offline-First Capabilities: Full integration of WatermelonDB for local persistence, sophisticated synchronization, and conflict resolution (detailed architectural plan already developed).
Advanced Analytics: More in-depth reporting and visualization of routine adherence and patterns.
Customizable Notifications: User-configurable reminders for tasks.
Theming/Customization: More extensive UI customization options for users.
Cross-Platform Expansion: Support for iOS.
Widget Support: Integration with home screen widgets for quick task viewing/completion.
11. Current State & Brownfield Context
As of the creation of this PRD, the project is in its foundational documentation phase. The existing codebase is primarily boilerplate and configuration files for a React Native Expo project. The core logic for tasks, recurrence, completion, and UI components is yet to be implemented. The memory-bank serves as the primary source of truth for all project context and technical decisions. The authentication, onboarding, core task management, navigation, settings, stats, health/happiness tracking, and task completion history are all features "left to build."

This PRD reflects the product vision and technical direction for the first functional version of RoutineTrace, building upon the established project context and existing technical stack.
